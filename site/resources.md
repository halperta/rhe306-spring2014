##Style Cheat Sheet
###MLA Citation
All quotations or paraphrase should be followed, at the end of the sentence, by the page number in parentheses. 

* In his article, McCarraher sheds light on Sandel’s point that “markets don’t wag fingers” (87).  
  
(For research summaries, the bibliographic information goes beneath the title.) All other bibliographies should be on a separate page at the end of the paper. They should be single-spaced, alphabetized, and separated by the main paper with a page break. The second line of the citation should be indented. 
* Illouz, Eva. “Does Money Undermine Social Relations?” *The Hedgehog Review* 14.3 (2012): 89+. *Academic OneFile.* Web. 23 Jan. 2014.
* McCarraher, Eugene. "Capitalism and Our Moral Imagination." *The Hedgehog Review* 14.3 (2012): 87+. *Academic OneFile.* Web. 23 Jan. 2014.  
  
Authors should be referred to by their full name the first time they are referenced, and by their last name for subsequent referrals. 

* Eva Illouz wrote a book review of Michael Sandel. In the review, Illouz explains many things.  
  
Titles of journal articles should be in quotation marks. Titles of books should be italicized. 

* In the article “Capitalism and Our Moral Imagination,” Eugene McCarraher offers a critique of Michael Sandel’s book *What Money Can’t Buy.*

###Punctuation
All punctuation goes inside quotation marks. 
* “Markets don’t wag fingers,” Sandel writes (87).
* We might refer to this, ironically, as “marketization.”
