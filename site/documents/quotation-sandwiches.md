title: Quotation Sandwiches

This is a strategy for thinking about the integration of evidence into a paragraph. The basic idea is that your writing functions as a sandwich in which your evidence is the meat, and your introduction and analysis act as bread. For an essay such as essays 1.1 and 2.1, you should *always* have both "meat" and "bread."

Here's an example:

The top of the quotation sandwich makes a claim:

	In his article “Your Massively Open Offline College is Broken,” Clay Shirky argues that MOOCs are important because the current system isn’t working. 

The middle of the sandwich presents the evidence that illustrates/supports this claim.

	As he puts it, “School is broken and everyone knows it” (1). The problem, he writes, is the cost of higher education: public college fees went up 72 percent in the last decade, while the market value of a bachelor’s degree decreased by 15 percent (1). 

The bottom of the sandwich interprets the evidence and explains how it supports the claim.

	In this context, a four-year education is not a viable option for most students, and the kind of education provided by traditional institutions does not meet the needs of the students attending them.

Now make a transition to another quotation sandwich.  

	For Shirky MOOCs, which are free and student-directed, resolve this problem....
