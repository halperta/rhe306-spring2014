#Evaluating Articles
##Author  

Who is the author?  Does the author have a public affiliation with any group?  Is the author part of a professional community?  What gives the author his/her authority?  



##Publisher  

What information is provided about the publisher?  How recent is the article?  
 

##Source

Does this news source generally lean to a particular side of controversies?  In other words, does the news source have a liberal or conservative bent?
What section of the newspaper or magazine does the article come from?
 

##Audience

What kind of people generally read the magazine, newspaper or website? Based on the author's writing, who is being addressed? Look at key information like what assumptions the author seems to be making about the audience's information or position in relation to the argument at hand.


#Evaluating Biased Writing


##Alternate Views

How, if at all, does the author address alternate viewpoints? What other sources (if any) are being referred to? What bias does the author attribute to the other positions?

##Emotional Keywords

What words does the author use that _reveal_ his or her position? Is emotional language used to describe any of the arguments in the article?
