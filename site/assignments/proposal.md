##Assignment Overview
Throughout this course, you will be required to select a single controversy, conduct research on your controversy, and write a series of essays related to your research. By the end of the semester, you will be an expert in the topic and controversy of your choice.  

This first assignment asks you to map out the shape of your research. The assignment has two parts: a worksheet that you will discuss with me at a meeting, and a spreadsheet which you will use to keep track of your research throughout the semester, and which you will turn in with each essay.  

You can download the proposal worksheet here: [proposal]({{ page.root }}documents/proposal.docx)  
You can download the research spreadsheet here: [spreadsheet]({{ page.root }}documents/Sources.xlsx)

##Evaluation
This assignment has two parts. The proposal is worth 60 percent of the grade and the spreadsheet is worth 40 percent of the grade. The parts will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

###Proposal
* Research Statement: Clearly articulated, compelling, of appropriate scope (manageable but not too narrow for a 14-week project). Special attention to the clear articulation of a specific controversy.  
* Project Import: Compelling statement of value.
* Event: you must find at least one relevant event in the past three years
* Stakeholders: you must identify at least three legitimate stakeholders.
* Keywords: Make sure your keywords give equal weight to all aspects of research
* Positions: You must identify at least three different positions

###Spreadsheet
* You should have at least five relevant sources
* At least one article should be "informational" and one should take a position
* At least three should come from sources that exist in print (even if you find it online - try newspapers or magazines like Time, Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, The New York Times, the Washington Post, etc. Everything from LexisNexis counts as a print source.) 
* Each must have all columns filled out. Note that I am not asking for complete sentences or paragraphs.

###Parameters
**Note: proposals that do not meet these parameters will not be accepted.**
