##Assignment Overview
Throughout this course, you will be required to select a single controversy, conduct research on your controversy, and write a series of essays related to your research. By the end of the semester, you will be an expert in the topic and controversy of your choice.  

This first assignment asks you to map out the shape of your research. The assignment has two parts: a worksheet that you will discuss with me at a meeting, and a spreadsheet which you will use to keep track of your research throughout the semester, and which you will turn in with each essay.
