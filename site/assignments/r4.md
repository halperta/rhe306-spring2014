##Assignment Overview

For essay 2, you will be asked to analyze the persuasive strategies of a single text that takes a position on your controversy. For this assignment, your task is to write a 400-500 word paper in which you analyzing how the author of your chosen text uses emotion to persuade his or her audience.  

Note that for our purposes, a "text" can be loosely defined as any persuasive effort that can be interpreted.  A "text" may be a print article (such as an opinion column in a newspaper).  It may also be a blog entry, a video, a commercial, an image, or a web-page.  You should select a text that makes a clear argument--a text that very clearly asks the audience to believe, feel, or do something. 

##Specifics

This research summary must include four sections:  

In the first section of your summary, briefly identify your controversy and explain how the source is relevant to your controversy. What position does the source take? Who is it by? Where was it published?  

In the second part of your summary, briefly summarize the emotional weight of the text by considering the following aspects: emotional language; anecdotes or comparisons that evoke feelings; emotionally charged metaphors, similes, etc.

In the third part of your summary, choose one emotional element of the text to analyze (for example, a single anecdote; the article's title; etc.) Introduce your hypothesis about the element. Describe the element by paraphrasing or quoting directly. Interpret that element to explain what emotions it evokes and what the importance of those emotions are for the article overall.

In your conclusion, sum up your analysis by explaining the relationship between the author's position, the article's context, and the emotional aspects of the author's writing.
