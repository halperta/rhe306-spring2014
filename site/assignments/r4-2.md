##Assignment Overview

For essay 2, you will be asked to analyze the persuasive strategies of a single text that takes a position on your controversy. For this assignment, your task is to identify and summarize the strategies the author uses to establish credibility in your chosen text. 

Note that for our purposes, a "text" can be loosely defined as any persuasive effort that can be interpreted.  A "text" may be a print article (such as an opinion column in a newspaper).  It may also be a blog entry, a video, a commercial, an image, or a web-page.  You should select a text that makes a clear argument--a text that very clearly asks the audience to believe, feel, or do something.
