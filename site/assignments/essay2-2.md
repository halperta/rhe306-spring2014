##General
Your purpose in this 4-6 page (1200-1800 words) essay is to closely analyze the different rhetorical strategies used in your controversy. You'll do this through the careful (textual and contextual) comparison of two texts advocating  positions in the controversy. You can choose two texts that advocate the same position in different ways, or two texts that advocate different positions.  

For our purposes, a "text" can be loosely defined as any persuasive effort that can be interpreted.  A "text" may be a print article (such as an opinion column in a newspaper).  It may also be a blog entry, a video, a commercial, an image, or a web-page.  You should select two texts that make a clear argument--that very clearly ask the audience to believe, feel, or do something. 

##Specifics
Your research questions for this essay are: 
* What are the rhetorical differences between the texts you are considering?
* What are the different effects that these strategies produce?
* Why might the two authors have chosen these different strategies?

To answer these questions, you'll want to start by providing the context for the two articles. Begin by introducing the two texts, briefly summarizing their content, and explaining how they take different (or similar) positions in your controversy.  
Next, describe the different contexts for the two texts. Compare the intended audience, cultural context, site of publication, etc.  
Then, compare the writing (or visual) presentation of the two texts. Consider, for example, the style that the texts use (formal vs informal, jargon vs. conversational, objective vs. personal, etc.); the rhetorical strategies used (logical constructions, anecdotes, refutations, emotional language, appeals to credibility); the bias of the article (weak or strong). You will want to describe the strategies used by the two texts, analyze the effect of these different (or similar) strategies, and offer some hypotheses about why the two strategies are being used.  
To conclude, summarize your analysis and offer some general evaluation: what does this analysis teach you about the discourse surrounding your controversy?
