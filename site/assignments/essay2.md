##General
Your purpose in this 4-6 page (1200-1800 words) essay is to closely analyze one position in your controversy. You'll do this through the careful (textual and contextual) analysis of a single text advocating a position. For our purposes, a "text" can be loosely defined as any persuasive effort that can be interpreted.  A "text" may be a print article (such as an opinion column in a newspaper).  It may also be a blog entry, a video, a commercial, an image, or a web-page.  You should select a text that makes a clear argument--a text that very clearly asks the audience to believe, feel, or do something.

##Specifics
Your essay should answer the questions:
* What strategies does the text use to persuade its audience?  
* Why does author use these strategies, and to what end?  
* Are these strategies effective and appropriate given the context?  

Your essay must begin with a strong introduction and thesis.  

You must contextualize the text by introducing the controversy, explaining the text's position in the controversy, summarizing its content, describing its publication context (author, site of publication), and explaining its audience.  

You should then look closely at three or more rhetorical aspects of the text. You might focus, for example, on: style, emotional language, anecdotes, rhetorical figures (like metaphors, etc.), pathos or logos, appeals to credibility, etc. For each aspect that you choose to analyze, first describe how it is used in the text. Then, analyze the effect of this use. Finally, offer a hypothesis about how this strategy plays into the overall argument the author is making.  

In your conclusion, you should summarize your analysis to explain *how* the text tries to persuade its audience and *why* it uses those strategies. In this section, you may offer an evaluation: do you consider these strategies effective? Why or why not?

* Overall structure & clarity
