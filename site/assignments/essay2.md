##General
Your purpose in this 4-6 page (1200-1800 words) essay is to closely analyze one position in your controversy. You'll do this through the careful (textual and contextual) analysis of a single text advocating a position. For our purposes, a "text" can be loosely defined as any persuasive effort that can be interpreted.  A "text" may be a print article (such as an opinion column in a newspaper).  It may also be a blog entry, a video, a commercial, an image, or a web-page.  You should select a text that makes a clear argument--a text that very clearly asks the audience to believe, feel, or do something. 

##Specifics
In this essay, you must accomplish a few goals.  Your primary task is to analyze the text's argument.  Introduce the text you'll be analyzing. Tell us, Who put this argument together? Where did the argument appear? Tell us about the audience: Who is likely to read, see, or watch this text? And tell us how the argument speaks to a controversy. You should briefly summarize what the text says, noting the central claims and key evidence. Nonetheless, the majority of your paper should be devoted to analyzing how the argument is put together as well as why the author(s) may have made specific rhetorical choices. You'll want to discern and describe, for example: 
* the intended audience 
* the cultural context in which the text was written (the larger conversation to which this text contributes) 
* where the text was published, seen, viewed, etc. 
* the reasons offered in support of the advocated position 
* any appeals to the audience's emotions or to the author's credibility 
* common rhetorical figures (metaphors, metonymy, synecdoche, etc.) utilized in making the persuasive case 
* what's at stake in this argument (what is to be gained or lost in it?) 

##Minimum Requirements
For a C or above, your essay must:

*	Be 4-6 pages (1200-1800 words) long, typed, double-spaced; have 1-inch margins and name, class, date at the top left corner of the first page with title centered two lines below the date 
*	Analyze the text's rhetoric with particular attention to specific elements (style, appeals, arrangement, etc.) and their relation to the audience, the context, and the controversy. 
*	Strategically and effectively incorporate at least 1 credible print source (in addition to the text analyzed) 
*	Document all sources accurately (in-text and on a Works Cited page) according to MLA style guides 
*	Be written effectively and coherently, with very few punctuation or grammatical errors 
*	Have been peer reviewed at the in-class workshop 
*	Be turned in on time and be accompanied by all previous drafts, pre-writing exercises, and written peer reviews
