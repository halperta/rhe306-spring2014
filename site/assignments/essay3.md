##General
Your purpose in this 5-7 page (1500-2100 word) essay is to write an article for a publication of your choice that advocates a position related to your controversy. You can choose any written medium, including a blog, an online magazine, a corporate journal, or a newspaper. In the first (longer) part of the essay, you will write an opinion article (approx. 1000-1500 words) in which you advocate for a particular position in your controversy. In the second part of the essay (500 to 1100 words), you will analyze your own rhetorical strategies, writing to convince me that you have constructed a successful and appropriate argument.

##Specifics
Choosing a context: In the upper left-hand corner, you must state the name and format of publication for your essay (for example: New York Times: Editorial or huffingtonpost.com: Blog).
 
Part One: Writing in the style of your chosen medium, you must construct a coherent argument in favor of a position of your choice. This argument should include at least one argument based on an ethos appeal, at least one argument based on a logos appeal, and at least one argument based on a pathos appeal. However, the most important thing is that you choose strategies that you consider effective and appropriate to your context.

Part Two: in the second part of your essay, you will need to analyze your own writing in order to convince me that you have constructed an effective argument. You need to explain how you demonstrate your credibility to your audience. You need to explain how much bias you chose to reveal in your writing, and why you think this is appropriate given the context you were writing for. Finally, you need to show how you are using rhetorical strategies to construct a coherent and convincing argument given the context of your publication.

##Minimum Requirements
For a C or above, your essay must:
* Be 5-7 (1500-2100) pages long, typed, double-spaced; have 1-inch margins and name, class, date at the top left corner of the first page with title centered two lines below the date
* Take a coherent and clearly stated position, and use rhetorical strategies to argue it. 
* Strategically and effectively refute at least 1 credible counter-argument
* Document all sources accurately (in-text and on a Works Cited page) according to MLA style guides
* Be written effectively and coherently, with very few punctuation or grammatical errors
* Have been presented in class and incorporated feedback.
* Be turned in on time.

##Evaluation

For Part 1, you will be evaluated based on:
* Writing: To what degree is your writing clear and free of grammatical/spelling/punctuation errors?  
* Style: To what degree does your style appropriately match the forum you are publishing in?  
* Persuasiveness: To what degree is your argument persuasive? Are the appeals effective? Is the structure coherent? Do you provide convincing evidence? (when appropriate)  
* Citation: Do you use correct MLA citation styles (regardless of the forum – even if the New York Times, for example, doesn’t cite, you need to)?  

For Part 2, you will be evaluated based on:  
* Writing: To what degree is your writing clear and free of grammatical/spelling/punctuation errors?
* Content: How fully and effectively do you address credibility, bias, and strategy?
* Persuasiveness: Is your argument persuasive?
