<h2 id='general'>General</h2>

<p>Your purpose in this 5-7 page essay is to map out the various positions within your chosen controversy, stating clearly what those positions are and then highlighting the relationships among them. Do not—no way, no how—present a one-sided view, as if those who argue certain positions don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about. If this is really a controversy, there are several legitimate positions possible, and your job is to articulate each position&#8217;s most compelling arguments.</p>

<p>One way to maintain a neutral ethos in this paper is to give each &#8220;side&#8221; an equal opportunity to present its position from its own perspective. Be sure to attribute statements to their original speakers or organizations: phrases such as &#8220;According to&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;As stated by&#8230;&#8221; along with verbs that indicate that someone has stated a particular position, such as argues, advocates, asserts and contends will indicate that the argument you are presenting is not necessarily your own.</p>

<p>Your audience for this essay will be concerned and interested but not particularly informed citizens who are looking to you to provide an unbiased lay of the land.</p>

<h2 id='specifics'>Specifics</h2>

<p>In the first few pages, you&#8217;ll want to sketch out the basics of this controversy for your audience and offer a sense of its significance. For example, you may want to explain what events turned this issue into a controversy, who this controversy affects, how the outcome of the controversy may affect them, and why this controversy is important to others (why should anyone else care?).</p>

<p>In the following pages, you&#8217;ll need to accomplish both of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>describe either the positions ranging across the entire field of the controversy or the various proposed solutions to the controversy (what we should do to fix the problem) or the various positions concerning some sub-topic within the controversy (i.e., assuming we do accept that marijuana has medicinal purposes, for example, in what cases or by what guidelines should its use be considered legal?). Feel free to choose any of the above approaches, but once you do, stick to it throughout.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>indicate the points of intersection and diversion among the positions</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Don&#8217;t forget to document your sources according to the MLA or APA documentation guides in Critical Situations and Easy Writer.</p>

<p>Conclude with a reiteration of the relations among the various positions.</p>
