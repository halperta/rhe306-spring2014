<h2 id='assignment_overview'>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>Throughout this course, you will be required to select a single controversy, conduct research on your controversy, and write a series of essays related to your research. By the end of the semester, you will be an expert in the topic and controversy of your choice.</p>

<p>This first assignment asks you to map out the shape of your research. The assignment has two parts: a worksheet that you will discuss with me at a meeting, and a spreadsheet which you will use to keep track of your research throughout the semester, and which you will turn in with each essay.</p>
